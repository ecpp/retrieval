3D CAD Part Retrieval System: Technical Recommendations
Based on your requirements for building a visual similarity-based retrieval system for 3D CAD parts, here's a comprehensive technical architecture and approach.
Recommended Architecture
I recommend a dual-encoder architecture with late fusion:
CopyPart Image → Image Encoder → Image Embedding
                                             \
                                              → Fusion Module → Final Embedding → Vector DB → Similarity Search
                                             /
BOM Metadata → Metadata Encoder → Metadata Embedding
Components:

Image Encoder:

Model: DINOv2 or ViT (Vision Transformer) instead of ResNet50
Rationale: DINOv2 outperforms ResNet for engineering parts as it captures both local details and global structure better


Metadata Encoder:

Model: Transformer-based encoder for BOM data
Features: Process part material, dimensions, assembly relationships, tolerances


Fusion Module:

Approach: Cross-attention mechanism between visual and metadata features
Weights: Learnable attention weights to balance importance of visual vs metadata features


Indexing System:

Vector DB: FAISS with HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World) indexing
Configuration: 96-128 dimensional embeddings, cosine similarity metric



Combining Visual Features with BOM Metadata
I recommend a cross-modal attention approach:

Extract visual features using the vision encoder
Process BOM metadata with the metadata encoder
Use cross-attention to let each modality attend to relevant features in the other
Train with a triplet loss function where:

Anchor: Query part image
Positive: Same part with different viewpoint/metadata
Negative: Different but similar-looking parts



This approach outperforms simple concatenation by learning which metadata attributes are relevant to specific visual features.
Indexing and Search Approach
For efficient retrieval at scale:

Primary Index: FAISS with HNSW (hierarchical navigable small world) algorithm

Rationale: HNSW provides O(log n) search complexity with high recall
Configuration: 16-32 connections per node, 4 layers for up to 1M parts


Pre-filtering:

Create category-specific indices based on part classification
Filter by metadata constraints before visual search
Use inverted file indices (IVF) for large datasets


Quantization:

Implement product quantization (PQ) to compress vectors
Use 8-bit scalar quantization for efficient memory usage



Image Preprocessing Pipeline

Normalization:

Resize to 224×224 or 256×256px (consistent across dataset)
Center parts in frame with consistent orientation
Normalize pixel values to [0,1] range


Augmentation (for training):

Random rotations (0-360°, CAD parts can be viewed from any angle)
Small perspective changes (±15°)
Minor zoom variations (0.9-1.1×)
Limited brightness/contrast adjustments


Edge Enhancement:

Apply Sobel filter to extract edge information
Concatenate edge maps with RGB channels as additional input features


Multi-view Encoding:

Generate 3-6 standard views of each part
Aggregate features from multiple views into a single embedding



Training Strategy
I recommend transfer learning with domain adaptation:

Base Model: Start with DINOv2 or ViT pre-trained on ImageNet
Domain Adaptation: Perform self-supervised learning on your unlabeled CAD parts dataset using contrastive learning
Fine-tuning:

First stage: Train only the fusion module and last few layers
Second stage: Fine-tune all layers with smaller learning rate (1e-5)


Training Regime:

Batch size: 64-128
Learning rate: 1e-4 with cosine decay
Epochs: 50-100 (with early stopping)



Evaluation Metrics
Track these metrics to evaluate system performance:

Retrieval Accuracy:

Precision@K (K=5,10,20)
Recall@K (K=5,10,20)
Mean Average Precision (MAP)
NDCG@10 (Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain)


Efficiency Metrics:

Query time (ms)
Index size
Memory consumption


A/B Testing:

Side-by-side comparison of results with/without metadata integration
User feedback on retrieval quality

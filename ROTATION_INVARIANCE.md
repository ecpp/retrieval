# Rotation Invariance in CAD Part Retrieval

This document explains how rotation invariance is implemented in the CAD part retrieval system.

## Problem

CAD parts are 3D objects that can be viewed from any angle. The same part might look different depending on its orientation in the image. Traditional image encoders (like ViT, ResNet, etc.) are not inherently rotation-invariant, which means they may assign different embeddings to the same part in different orientations.

This can lead to issues where:
- The same part in different orientations gets a low similarity score
- Different parts in similar orientations get a higher similarity score than the same part in different orientations

## Solution

To achieve rotation invariance, the system now implements a multi-orientation approach:

1. For each query image, the system generates multiple rotated versions (default: 8 rotations covering 360Â°)
2. Each rotated version is encoded separately
3. The system searches for similar parts using all rotated embeddings
4. Results are combined, keeping the highest similarity score for each unique part
5. Final results are sorted by similarity and returned

This approach ensures that parts that are geometrically identical but in different orientations will be correctly identified as similar.

## Usage

Rotation invariance is enabled by default in the retrieval system, but can be controlled via command-line arguments:

```bash
# Enable rotation invariance (default)
python main.py retrieve --query path/to/image.png --rotation-invariant

# Specify number of rotations (default: 8)
python main.py retrieve --query path/to/image.png --rotation-invariant --num-rotations 12

# Disable rotation invariance
python main.py retrieve --query path/to/image.png
```

## Visualizing Rotations

You can visualize the rotations that are tried for a given image using:

```bash
python check_rotations.py --image path/to/image.png --num-rotations 8 --output rotations.png
```

This will save a visualization showing the original image and all rotated versions that will be used in the search.

## Performance Considerations

Enabling rotation invariance increases the search time by approximately N times, where N is the number of rotations. However, the improvement in retrieval accuracy often justifies this additional computation time, especially for CAD parts where orientation shouldn't affect matching.

For very large datasets, you may want to consider:
1. Reducing the number of rotations (e.g., 4 instead of 8)
2. Implementing parallel processing for the rotations
3. Using rotation-invariant features or models from the start

## Future Improvements

Future plans for improving rotation invariance include:

1. Implementing 3D rotation invariance (currently limited to 2D rotations)
2. Training a custom rotation-invariant encoder specifically for CAD parts
3. Optimizing the rotation search with early stopping when high-confidence matches are found
